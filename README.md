i would recommend looking at pseudo-r's reverse engineered api.

simplistic, but a lot of it is mainly just reliant on how good the information is fed to GPT-4 turbo.
better api = better outputs 
i'm just using it because it's free, but if i really cared about quality, i would recommend using a paid subscription api service.
